//
STORE    ===   REDUCER    === ACTION

Take an exaple of book store where a person want to buy a book (ACTION)
so he say to the book store that Please give me a book and book store person (REDUCER) go to the store and make changes in the store where the books (STATES) are stored

Rules for redux

1)  The state of the store is a OBJECT TREE structure IN A SINGLE STORE
{
    numberOfBooks:10
}
2) ONLY way to change the state EMIT a action, (object describing the action)
{
    Type:"buyCakes"
